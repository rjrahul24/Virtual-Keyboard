# Virtual-Keyboard

The Virtual Keyboard Assistant is operated using the Camera mouse tool in order to turn your eyes into a mouse pointer and use the on-screen virtual keyboard designed specially for physically disabled people.

Feature Implementation:
1. The users logs into the system and the virtual keyboard opens in the background.
2. Camera Mouse uses the system's attached camera to help the user navigate using gestures.
3. The user needs to register a body part (forehead, arms, hand, etc.) and the movement of this body part will trigger the movement of the mouse.
4. The keyboard also implements special features for physically challenged users like:
    a. Asking for helping through voice instructions.
    b. Browsing the internet through an attached browser.
    c. Converting voice instructions to speech, to supplement writing of emails, etc.

Camera Mouse is a free program that allows you to control the mouse pointer on a Windows computer just by moving your head. Clicking can be done by making the mouse pointer dwell over a spot on the screen (after first turning Clicking on in Settings).
The program was developed at Boston College to help people with disabilities use the computer. The main audience for this program is people who do not have reliable control of a hand but who can move their head. People with Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis, Traumatic Brain Injury, various neurological disorders use this program and its predecessors to run all types of computer software.
